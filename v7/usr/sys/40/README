The m40.s here is purported to support 7th edition Unix
on the 11/40, 11/60, and 11/23.  It has, in fact,
worked on the latter machine.
The param.h is included because various sizes have to
be cut down considerably; this is a guide.
(Things will be tight!  You might consider removing some system calls
you don't care about, like accounting.)
Also, it is necessary to remove the
	.data
from line 3 of the l.s file, because the interrupt
vectors and such should go in I space.

Support is included for FP11-style floating point
but I can't vouch for it.
