.TH GETTY 8 
.SH NAME
getty  \- set typewriter mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/getty
[ char ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Getty
is invoked
by
.IR  init (8)
immediately after a typewriter is opened
following a dial-up.
It reads the user's login name and calls
.IR login (1)
with the name as argument.
While reading the name
.I getty
attempts to adapt the system to the speed and type of terminal
being used.
.PP
.I Init
calls
.I getty
with a single character argument taken from
the
.IR ttys (5)
file entry for the terminal line.
This argument determines a sequence of line speeds through which
.I getty
cycles, and also the `login:' greeting message,
which can contain character sequences to put various kinds of
terminals in useful states.
.PP
The user's name is terminated by a new-line or
carriage-return character.
In the second case CRMOD mode is set
(see
.IR  ioctl (2)).
.PP
The name is scanned to see if
it contains any lower-case alphabetic characters; if not,
and if the name is nonempty, the
system is told to map any future upper-case characters
into the corresponding lower-case characters.
.PP
If the terminal's `break' key is depressed,
.I getty
cycles to the next speed appropriate to the type of line
and prints the greeting message again.
.PP
Finally, login is called with the user's name as argument.
.PP
The following arguments from the
.I ttys
file are understood.
