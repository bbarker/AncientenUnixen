.TH UUCP 1C 
.SH NAME
uucp, uulog \- unix to unix copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uucp
[ option ] ...
source-file ...  destination-file
.PP
.B uulog
[ option ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Uucp
copies files named by the source-file arguments
to the destination-file argument.
A file name may be a path name on your machine, or may 
have the form
.IP
system-name!pathname
.LP
where `system-name' is taken from a list of system names
which
.I uucp
knows about.
Shell metacharacters ?*[] appearing in the pathname part
will be expanded on the appropriate system.
.PP
Pathnames may be one of
.IP (1)
a full pathname;
.IP (2)
a pathname preceded by
.IR ~user ;
where
.I user
is a userid on the specified system
and is replaced by that user's login directory;
.IP (3)
anything else is prefixed by the current directory.
.PP
If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote system
the copy will fail.
If the destination-file is a directory, the last part of the
source-file name is used.
.ig
If a simple
.I ~user
destination is inaccessible to 
.I uucp,
data is copied to a spool directory and the user
is notified by
.IR mail (1).
..
.PP
.I Uucp
preserves execute permissions across the transmission
and gives 0666 read and write permissions (see
.IR chmod (2)).
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
.IR uucp .
.TP 
.B \-d
Make all necessary directories for the file copy.
.TP 
.B \-c
Use the source file when copying out rather than
copying the file to the spool directory.
.TP 
.B \-m
Send mail to the requester when the copy is complete.
.PP
.I Uulog
maintains a summary log
of 
.I uucp
and
.IR uux (1)
transactions in the file
`/usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE' by gathering
information from partial log files named `/usr/spool/uucp/LOG.*.?'.
It removes the partial log files.
.PP
The options cause 
.I uulog 
to print logging information:
.TP
.BI \-s sys
Print information about work involving system
.I sys.
.TP
.BI \-u user
Print information about work done for the specified
.I user.
.SH FILES

D. A. Nowitz,
.I Uucp Implementation Description
.SH WARNING
The domain of remotely accessible files can
(and for obvious security reasons, usually should)
be severely restricted.
You will very likely not be able to fetch files
by pathname;
ask a responsible person on the remote system to
send them to you.
For the same reasons you will probably not be able
to send files to arbitrary pathnames.
.SH BUGS
.br
All files received by
.I uucp
will be owned by uucp.
.br
The \-m option will only work sending files or receiving
a single file.
(Receiving multiple files specified by special shell
characters ?*[] will not activate
the \-m option.)
