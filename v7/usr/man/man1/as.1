.SH DESCRIPTION
.I As
assembles the concatenation of the named files.
If the optional first argument
.B \-
is used,
all undefined symbols in the assembly
are treated as global.
.PP
The output of the assembly is left on the file
.I objfile;
if that is omitted,
.B a.out
is used.
It is executable if no errors occurred
during the assembly,
and if there were no unresolved external references.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When
an input file cannot be read, its name
followed by a question mark is typed and assembly
ceases.
When syntactic or semantic errors occur, a single-character diagnostic is typed out
together with the line number and the file name in which it
occurred.
Errors in pass 1 cause cancellation of pass 2.
The possible errors are:
.PP

]	Parentheses error

<	String not terminated properly

.br
a	Error in address

b	Branch instruction is odd or too remote
.br
e	Error in expression
.br
f	Error in local (`f' or `b') type symbol
.br
g	Garbage (unknown) character
.br
i	End of file inside an if
.br
m	Multiply defined symbol as label
