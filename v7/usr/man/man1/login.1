.TH LOGIN 1 
.SH NAME
login  \-  sign on
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B login
[ username ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I login
command
is used when a user initially
signs on, or it may be used at any time to change
from one user to another.
The latter case is the one summarized above and
described here.
See `How to Get Started' for how to dial up initially.
.PP
If
.I login
is invoked without an argument,
it asks for a user name, and, if
appropriate, a password.
Echoing is turned off (if possible) during the typing of the password,
so it will not appear on the written record of the
session.
.PP
After a successful login,
accounting files are updated and
the user is informed of the
existence of
.I .mail
and message-of-the-day files.
.I Login
initializes the user and group IDs and the working directory,
then executes a command interpreter (usually
.IR  sh (1))
according to specifications found in a password file.
Argument 0 of the command interpreter is `\-sh.
.PP
Login is recognized by
.IR sh (1)
and executed directly (without forking).
