# AncientenUnixen
Just a collection of others' Unix implementations for educational purposes, centering around v6/v7

Implementations may have different licenses; this repository is
primarily for my personal convenenience and archival, and I encourage
you to check the URLs for original or possibly updated sources and
licences.

## What's included

### Truly Ancient C

- [v6](v6) and also [Lions Commentary(source+PDF)](LionsCommentary) and also [doc version](v6doc); from [here](https://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v6/) by way of [The Unix Tree](https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl).
- [v7](v7) from
  [here](https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7) by way of
  [The Unix Tree](https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl): The
  Seventh Edition of Unix was released by Bell Laboratories in January
  1979, ~four years after Sixth Edition. The structure of the kernel
  was significantly altered, with many bugs removed and features
  added: larger filesystems, less restrictions on user accounts,
  improved portability. At the user level, new library functions were
  added (such as the Standard I/O library), and many new applications
  arrived: awk, f77, lex, lint, m4, make, sed, tar, uucp.
