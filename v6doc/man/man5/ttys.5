.th TTYS V 2/11/75
.sh NAME
ttys \*- typewriter initialization data
.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it ttys
file is read by the
.it init
program and specifies
which typewriter special files are to have
a process created for them which will allow people to
log in.
It consists of lines of 3 characters each.
.s3
The first character is either `0' or `1';
the former causes the line to be ignored,
the latter causes it to be effective.
The second character is the last character in the name
of a typewriter; e.g. \fIx\fR refers to
the file `/dev/tty\fIx\fR'.
The third character is used as an argument
to the
.it getty
program,
which performs such tasks as baud-rate recognition,
reading the login name,
and calling
.it login.
For normal lines,
the character is `0';
other characters can be used, for example, with hard-wired terminals
where speed recognition is unnecessary
or which have special characteristics.
(Getty will have to be fixed in such cases.)
