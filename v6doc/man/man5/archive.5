.th ARCHIVE V 9/10/73
.sh NAME
ar \*- archive (library) file format
.sh DESCRIPTION
The archive command
.it ar
is used to combine several files into
one.
Archives are used mainly as libraries to be searched
by the link-editor
.it ld.
.s3
A file produced by
.it ar
has a magic number at the start,
followed by the constituent files, each preceded by a file header.
The magic number is
177555(8)
(it was chosen to be unlikely to occur anywhere else).
The header of each file is 16 bytes long:
.s3
.lp +13 8
0-7	file
name, null padded on the right
.lp +13 8
8-11	modification
time of the file
.lp +13 8
12	user ID of file owner
.lp +13 8
13	file mode
.lp +13 8
14-15	file size
.s3
.i0
Each file begins on a word boundary;
a null byte is inserted between files if necessary.
Nevertheless the size give reflects the
actual size of the file exclusive of padding.
.s3
Notice there is no provision for empty areas in an archive
file.

ar (I), ld (I)
.sh BUGS
Names are only 8 characters, not 14.
More important, there isn't enough room to
store the proper mode,
so
.it ar
always extracts in mode 666.
