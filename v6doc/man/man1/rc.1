.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Rc
invokes the Ratfor preprocessor on a set of Ratfor source files.
It accepts three types of arguments:
.s3
Arguments whose names end with `.r' are taken to be
Ratfor source programs; they are 
preprocessed into Fortran and compiled.
Each subroutine or function `name' is placed on a separate file
.it name.f,
and its object code is left on
.it name.o.
The main routine is on
.it MAIN.f
and
.it MAIN.o;
block data subprograms go on
.it blockdata?.f
and
.it blockdata?.o.
The files resulting from a `.r' file are
loaded into a single object file
.it file.o,
and the intermediate object and Fortran files are removed.
.s3
The following flags are interpreted by
.it rc.
See
.it "ld (I)"
for load-time flags.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-c\fR	Suppresses the loading phase of the compilation,
as does any error in anything.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-f\fR	Save Fortran intermediate files.
This is primarily for debugging.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-r\fR	Ratfor only; don't try to compile the Fortran.
This implies
.bd \*-f
and
.bd \*-c.
.s3
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-v\fR	Don't list intermediate file names while compiling.
.i0
.dt
.s3
Arguments whose names end with `.f' are taken to be
Fortran source programs;
they are compiled in the normal manner.
(Only one Fortran routine is allowed in a `.f' file.)
Other arguments
are taken
to be either loader flag arguments, or Fortran-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
.it rc
run,
or perhaps libraries of Fortran-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are loaded
to produce an executable program with name
.bd a.out.

Yes, both from

itself and from Fortran.
.sh BUGS
Limit of about 50 arguments, 10 block data files.
.s3
#define and #include lines in
``.f'' files are not processed.
