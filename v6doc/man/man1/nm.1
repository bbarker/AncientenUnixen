.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Nm
prints the symbol table from the output file of an
assembler or loader run.
Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if undefined)
and one of the letters \fBU\fR (undefined) \fBA\fR (absolute) \fBT\fR
(text segment symbol),
\fBD\fR (data segment symbol), \fBB\fR
(bss segment symbol),
or \fBC\fR (common symbol).
If the symbol is local (non-external)
the type letter is in lower case.
The output is sorted alphabetically.
