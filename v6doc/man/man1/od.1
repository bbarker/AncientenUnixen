.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd od
[
.bd \*-abcdho
] [ file ] [ [
.bd +
] offset[ \fB. \fR][ \fBb\fR ] ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Od
dumps
.it file
in
one or more formats
as
selected by the first argument.
If the first argument is missing
.bd \*-o
is default.
The meanings of the format argument characters
are:
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBa\fR	interprets words as PDP-11 instructions and
dis-assembles the operation code.
Unknown operation codes print as ???.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBb\fR	interprets bytes in octal.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBc\fR	interprets bytes in ascii.
Unknown ascii characters are printed as \\?.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBd\fR	interprets words in decimal.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBh\fR	interprets words in hex.
.s3
.lp +3 3
\fBo\fR	interprets words in octal.

.i0
The \fIfile\fR argument specifies which file is to be dumped.
If no file argument is specified,
the standard input is used.
Thus
.it od
can be used as a filter.
.s3
The offset argument specifies the offset
in the file where dumping is to commence.
This argument is normally interpreted
as octal bytes.
If `\fB.\fR' is appended, the offset is interpreted in
decimal.
If `\fBb\fR' is appended, the offset is interpreted in blocks.
(A block is 512 bytes.)
If the file argument is omitted,
the offset argument must be preceded by `\fB+\fR'.
.s3
Dumping continues until end-of-file.
