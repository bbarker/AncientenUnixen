.th PFE I 11/1/73
.sh NAME
pfe \*- print floating exception
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd pfe
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Pfe
examines the floating point exception register and
prints a diagnostic for the last
floating point exception.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
signal (II)
.sh BUGS
Since the system does not save the exception register
in a core image file,
the message
refers to the last error encountered by anyone.
Floating exceptions are therefore volatile.
