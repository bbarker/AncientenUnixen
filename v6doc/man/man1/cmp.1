.sh NAME
cmp \*- compare two files
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd cmp
[
.bd \*-l
] [
.bd \*-s
]
file1 file2
.sh DESCRIPTION
The two files are
compared.
(If
.it file1
is `\*-',
the standard input is used.)
Under default options,
.it cmp
makes no comment if the files are the same;
if they differ, it announces the byte and line number
at which the difference occurred.
If one file is an initial subsequence
of the other, that fact is noted.
Moreover, return code 0 is yielded for identical
files, 1 for different files, and 2 for an
inaccessible or missing argument.
