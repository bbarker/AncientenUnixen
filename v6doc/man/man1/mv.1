.th MV I 8/20/73
.sh NAME
mv  \*-  move or rename a file
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd mv
name1 name2
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mv
changes the name of
.it name1
to
.it name2.
If
.it name2
is a directory,
.it name1
is moved to
that directory with its original file-name.
Directories may only be moved within the same parent
directory (just renamed).
.s3
If
.it name2
already exists,
it is removed before
.it name1
is renamed.
If
.it name2
has a mode which forbids writing,
.it mv
prints the mode and
reads the standard input to obtain a line;
if the line begins with
.bd y,
the move takes place;
if not,
.it mv
exits.
.s3
If
.it name2
would lie on a different file system,
so that a simple rename is impossible,
.it mv
copies the file
and deletes the original.
.sh BUGS
It should take a
.bd "\*-f"
flag, like
.it rm,
to suppress the question
if the target exists and is not writable.
