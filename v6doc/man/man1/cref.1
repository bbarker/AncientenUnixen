.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Cref
makes a cross reference listing
of program files in assembler or C format. The files
named as arguments in the command
line are searched for symbols 
in the appropriate syntax.
.s3
The output report is in four columns:
.nf
.s3
(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)
symbol	file	see	text as it appears in file
		below
.s3
.fi
.it Cref
uses either an
.it ignore
file or an
.it only
file.
If the
.bd \*-i
option is given, the next
argument is taken to be an
.it ignore
file; if the
.bd \*-o
option is given, the next
argument is taken to be
an
.it only
file.
.it Ignore
and
.it only
files are lists of symbols separated by new lines.
All symbols in an
.it ignore
file
are ignored in columns (1) and (3) of the output.
If an
.it only
file is given, only symbols in that
file appear in column (1).
At most one of
.bd \*-i
and
.bd \*-o
may be used.
The default setting
is
.bd \*-i.
Assembler predefined symbols or C keywords are ignored.
.s3
The
.bd \*-s
option causes current symbols to be
put in column 3.
In the assembler, the current symbol
is the most recent name symbol;
in C, the current function name.
The
.bd \*-l
option causes the line number within the file
to be put in column 3.
.s3
The
.bd \*-t
option causes the next available argument
to be used as the name
of the intermediate temporary
file (instead of /tmp/crt??).
The file is created and
is not removed at the end of the process.
