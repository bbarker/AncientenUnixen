.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Getuid
returns a word (in r0),
the low byte of which contains
the real user ID of
the current process.
The high byte contains the effective user ID
of the current process.
The real user ID identifies the person who is logged in,
in contradistinction to the effective user ID, which
determines his access permission at the moment.
It is thus useful to programs which operate using
the ``set user ID'' mode, to find out who invoked them.
