.sh DESCRIPTION
Given
a file descriptor such as returned from an
.it open,
.it creat,
or
.it pipe
call,
.it close
closes the associated file.
A close of all files is automatic on
.it exit,
but since
processes are limited to 15 simultaneously open files,
.it close
is necessary for programs which deal with many files.
.sh "SEE ALSO"
creat (II), open (II), pipe (II)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS

(c-bit) is set for an unknown file descriptor.
