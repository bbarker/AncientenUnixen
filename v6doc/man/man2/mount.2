.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mount
announces to the system that a removable file system has
been mounted on
the block-structured special file
.it special;
from now on, references to file
.it name
will refer to
the root file on the newly mounted file system.
.it Special
and
.it name
are pointers to null-terminated strings
containing the appropriate path names.
.s3
.it Name
must exist already. 
Its old contents
are inaccessible while the file system
is mounted.
.s3
The
.it rwflag
argument determines whether
the file system can be written on; if it is 0 writing
is allowed, if non-zero no writing is done.
Physically write-protected and magnetic
tape file systems must be mounted read-only or
errors will occur when access times are updated,
whether or not any
explicit write is attempted.
