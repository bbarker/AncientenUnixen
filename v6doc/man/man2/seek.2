The file
descriptor refers to a file open for reading or writing.
The read (resp. write) pointer for the file is set as follows:
.s3
.lp +6 3
if
.it ptrname
is 0, the pointer is set to
.it offset.
.s3
.lp +6 3
if
.it ptrname
is 1, the pointer is set to its current location plus
.it offset.
.s3
.lp +6 3
if
.it ptrname
is 2, the pointer is set to the size of the
file plus
.it offset.
.s3
.lp +6 3
if
.it ptrname
is 3, 4 or 5,
the meaning is as above for
0, 1 and 2 except that
the offset is
multiplied by 512.

is 0 or 3,
