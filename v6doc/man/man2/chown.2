.sh DESCRIPTION
The file
whose name is given by the null-terminated string pointed
to by
.it name
has its owner and group changed to
the low and high bytes of
.it owner
respectively.
Only the super-user may
execute this call,
because if users were able to give files away,
they could defeat the (nonexistent)
file-space accounting procedures.

on illegal owner changes.
