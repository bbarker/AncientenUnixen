.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd ncheck
[

.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Ncheck
with no argument
generates a pathname vs. i-number
list of all files
on a set of default file systems.
The
.bd \*-i
flag reduces the report to only those files whose i-numbers follow.
.bd \*-a
allows printing of the names `.' and `..', which are ordinarily
suppressed.
A file system may be specified.
.s3
The full report is in no useful
order, and probably should be sorted.
