.th SU VIII 10/31/73
.sh NAME
su  \*-  become privileged user
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd su
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Su
allows one to become the super-user, who has
all sorts of marvelous (and correspondingly dangerous) powers.
In order for \fIsu\fR to do its magic, the user must
supply a password.
If the password is correct, \fIsu\fR
will execute the Shell with the UID set to
that of the super-user.
To restore normal UID privileges,
type an end-of-file to the super-user Shell.
.s3
The password demanded is that of the entry ``root''
in the system's password file.
.s3
To remind the super-user of his responsibilities,
the Shell substitutes `#' for its usual prompt `%'.
