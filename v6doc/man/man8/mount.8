.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /etc/mount
special file [
.bd \*-r
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Mount
announces to the system that a removable file system
is present on the device corresponding to special
file
.it special
(which must refer to a disk or possibly DECtape).
The
.it file
must exist already; it
becomes the name of the root of the newly mounted
file system.
.s3
.it Mount
maintains a table of mounted devices;
if invoked without an argument it prints the table.
.s3
The optional last argument indicates that the file
is to be mounted read-only.
Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file
systems must be mounted in this way
or errors will occur when access times are updated,
whether or not any explicit write is attempted.

.sh BUGS
