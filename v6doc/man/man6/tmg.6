.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Tmg

and translation rules are described in file \fIname\fB.t\fR.
The new translator appears
in a.out and may be used thus:
.s3
.bd a.out

.s3
Except in rare cases input must be a randomly
addressable file.
If no output file is specified, the standard output file
is assumed.

with which the Tmg processor or a Tmg-produced

a dump.
