.th GRAPH VI 2/20/75
.sh NAME
graph \*- draw a graph
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd graph
[ option ] ... | plotter
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Graph
with no options takes pairs of numbers from the
standard input as abscissas and
ordinates of a graph.
The graph is written on the standard output to be piped
to the plotter program for a particular device;
see
.it plot
(VI).
These plotters exist:
.it gsip,
for the GSI and other Diablo terminals;
.it tek,
for the Tektronix 4014 terminal;
and
.it vt0
for the on-line storage scope.
.s3
The following options are recognized,
each as a separate argument.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBa\fR	Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from
the input); spacing is given by the next
argument, or is assumed to be 1 if next argument is not a number.
A second optional argument is the starting point for the
automatic abscissa.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBc\fR	Place character string given by next argument
at each point.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBd\fR	Omit connections between points. (Disconnect.)
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBg\fIn\fR	Grid
style:
.lp +5 0
\fIn\fR=0, no grid
.lp +5 0
\fIn\fR=1, axes only
.lp +5 0
\fIn\fR=2, complete grid (default).
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBs\fR	Save screen, don't erase before plotting.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBx\fR	Next 1 (or 2) arguments are lower (and upper) \fIx\fR limits.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBy\fR	Next 1 (or 2) arguments are lower (and upper)
\fIy\fR limits.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBh\fR	Next argument is fraction of space for height
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBw\fR	Next argument is fraction of space for width.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBr\fR	Next argument is fraction of space to move right before plotting.
.s3
.lp +5 5
\fBu\fR	Next argument is fraction of space to move up before plotting.
.s3
.i0
Points are connected by straight line segments in the order
they appear in input.
If a specified lower limit exceeds the upper limit, or if
the automatic increment is negative, the graph is plotted
upside down.
Automatic abscissas begin with the lower \fIx\fR limit, or with 0
if no limit is specified.
Grid lines and automatically determined limits fall on round
values, however roundness
may be subverted by giving an inappropriately rounded
lower limit.
Plotting symbols specified by
.bd c
are
placed so that a small initial letter,
such as + o x, will fall
approximately on the plotting point.

A limit of 1000 points is enforced silently.
