.sh DESCRIPTION
The
.it getarg
entry fills in
.it iarray
(which is considered to be
.it integer)
with the Hollerith string representing the
.it i
th
argument to the command
in which it it is called.
If no
.it isize
argument is specified,
at least one blank is placed after the argument,
and the last word affected is blank padded.
The user should make sure that the array is big enough.
.s3
If the
.it isize
argument is given,
the argument will be followed by blanks
to fill up
.it isize
words, but even if the argument is long no more than
that many words will be filled in.
.s3
The blank-padded array is suitable for use as an
argument to setfil (III).
.s3
The
.it iargc
entry returns the number of arguments to the command,
counting the first (file-name) argument.
