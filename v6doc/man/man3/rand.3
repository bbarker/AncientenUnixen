.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Rand
uses a multiplicative congruential
random number generator to return successive pseudo-random
numbers (in r0) in the range from 0 to 2\u\s715\s10\d\*-1.
.s3
The generator is reinitialized by calling
.it srand
with 1 as argument (in r0).
It can be set to a random starting point by calling
.it srand
with whatever you like as argument,
for example the low-order word
of the time.
.sh BUGS
The low-order bits are not very random.
