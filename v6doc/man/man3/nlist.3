the given executable output file
and selectively extracts a
list of values.
The name list consists of
a list of 8-character names (null padded)
each followed by two words.
The list is terminated with a null name.
Each name is looked up in the name list of
the file.
If the name is found, the type and value of the
name are placed in the two words following
the name.
If the name is not found, the type entry is set to \*-1.
