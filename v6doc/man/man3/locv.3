.th LOCV III 3/9/74
.sh NAME
locv \*- long output conversion
.sh SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
char *locv(hi, lo)
int hi, lo;
.fi
.ft R
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Locv
converts a signed double-precision integer,
whose parts are passed as arguments,
to the equivalent ASCII character string
and returns a pointer to that string.
.sh BUGS
Since
.it locv
returns a pointer to a static buffer containing the
converted result, it cannot be used twice
in the same expression;
the second result overwrites the first.
