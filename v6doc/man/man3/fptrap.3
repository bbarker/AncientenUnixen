.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Fptrap
is a simulator of the
11/45 FP11-B floating point unit.
It works by intercepting illegal instruction
traps
and decoding and executing the floating point operation codes.
.sh FILES
In systems with real floating point,
there is a fake routine in /lib/liba.a with this name;
when simulation is desired,
the real version should be put in liba.a
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
A break point trap is given when a real
illegal instruction trap occurs.
