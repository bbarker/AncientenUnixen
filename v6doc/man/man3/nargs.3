.th NARGS III 5/10/73
.sh NAME
nargs \*- argument count
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd "nargs( )"
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Nargs
returns the number of actual parameters
supplied by the caller of the routine which calls 
\fInargs\fR.
.s3
The argument count is accurate only when
none of the actual parameters is
.it float
or
\fIdouble\fR.
Such parameters count as four arguments instead of one.
.sh BUGS
As indicated.
Also, this routine does not work (and cannot be made
to work) in programs with separated I and D space.
Altogether it is best to avoid using this
routine and depend, for example,
on passing an explicit argument count.
