Appendix B: Use of Yacc on Unix
.PP
Suppose that the Yacc specification is on a file called
yfile.
If the actions are in C, Yacc is invoked by
.DS
yacc yfile
.DE
The output appears on file y.tab.c 
To compile the parser and load it with
the Yacc library, use the command
.DS
cc y.tab.c \-ly
.DE
If Yacc is invoked with the option \-v:
.DS
yacc \-v yfile
.DE
a verbose description of the parser is produced on file y.output.
The C user should consult section
6C for more information about the run time environment.
.PP
If the actions are in Ratfor,
the user should invoke Yacc with the option \-r:
.DS
yacc \-r yfile
.DE
The Ratfor output appears on file y.tab.r 
It may be compiled by
.DS
rc \-2 y.tab.r
.DE
Note that when Yacc is used to produce Ratfor
programs, there is no need to load these programs with any library.
.PP
If the \-v action is also invoked:
.DS
yacc \-rv yfile
.DE
a verbose description of the parser is produced on file y.output.
The Ratfor user should consult section 6R for more information about
the run time environment.
