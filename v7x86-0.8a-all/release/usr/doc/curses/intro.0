.)l

This document describes a package of C library functions
which allow the user to:
.ie t .ip \ \ \ \(bu
.el .ip 1)
update a screen with reasonable optimization,
.ie t .ip \ \ \ \(bu
.el .ip 2)
get input from the terminal
in a screen-oriented fashion,
and
.ie t .ip \ \ \ \(bu
.el .ip 3)
independent from the above, move the cursor optimally
from one point to another.
.pp
These routines all use the
\*(tc \*(db to describe the capabilities of the terminal.

This package would not exist
without the work of Bill Joy,
who,
in writing his editor,
created the capability to generally describe terminals,
wrote the routines which read this \*(db,
and, most importantly,
those which implement optimal cursor movement,
which routines I have simply lifted nearly intact.
Doug Merritt and Kurt Shoens also were extremely important,
as were both willing to waste time listening to me rant and rave.
The help and/or support of
Ken Abrams,
Alan Char,
Mark Horton,
and
Joe Kalash,
was, and is,
also greatly appreciated.
