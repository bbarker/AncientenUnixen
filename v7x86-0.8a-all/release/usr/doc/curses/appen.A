.sh 1 "Capabilities from termcap" 1
.sh 2 Disclaimer
.pp
The description of terminals is a difficult business,
and we only attempt to summarize the capabilities here:
for a full description see the paper describing termcap.
.sh 2 Overview
.pp
Capabilities from termcap are of three kinds:
string valued options,
numeric valued options,
and boolean options.
The string valued options are the most complicated,
since they may include padding information,
which we describe now.
.pp
Intelligent terminals often require padding on intelligent operations
at high (and sometimes even low) speed.
This is specified by a number before the string in the capability,
and has meaning for the capabilities which have a
.b P
at the front of their comment.
This normally is a number of milliseconds to pad the operation.
In the current system which has no true programmable delays,
we do this by sending a sequence of pad characters
(normally nulls, but can be changed
(specified by
.i PC )).
In some cases, the pad is better computed as some number of milliseconds
times the number of affected lines
(to the bottom of the screen usually,
except when terminals have insert modes which will shift several lines.)
This is specified as, e.g.,
.b 12* .
before the capability,
to say 12 milliseconds per affected whatever
(currently always line).
Capabilities where this makes sense say
.b P* .
