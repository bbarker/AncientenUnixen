.De
Gets a character from the terminal and (if necessary)
echos it on the window.
\*(Es
Otherwise, the character gotten is returned.
If
.i noecho
has been set, then the window is left unaltered.
In order to retain control of the terminal,
it is necessary to have one of
.i noecho ,
.i cbreak ,
or
.i rawmode
set.
If you do not set one,
whatever routine you call to read characters will set
.i cbreak
for you,
and then reset to the original mode when finished.

.De
Get a string through the window
and put it in the location pointed to by
.Vn str ,
which is assumed to be large enough to handle it.
It sets tty modes if necessary,
and then calls
.Fn getch
(or
.Fn wgetch ) "" win
to get the characters needed to fill in the string
until a newline or EOF is encountered.
The newline stripped off the string.
