The program
.UL ratfor
is the basic translator; it takes either a list
of file names or the standard input and writes
Fortran on the standard output.
Options include
.UL \-6x ,
which uses
.UL x
as a continuation character in column 6
.UC UNIX "" (
uses 
.UL & 
in column 1),
and
.UL \-C ,
which causes Ratfor comments to be copied into
the generated Fortran.
.PP
The program
.UL rc
provides an interface to the
.UL ratfor
command which is much the same as
.UL cc .
Thus
.P1
rc [options] files
.P2
compiles the files specified by
.UL files .
Files with names ending in
.UL \&.r
are Ratfor source; other files are assumed to
be for the loader.
The flags
.UL \-C 
and
.UL \-6x
described above are recognized, as are
.P1
-c	compile only; don't load
-f	save intermediate Fortran .f files
-r	Ratfor only; implies -c and -f
-2	use big Fortran compiler (for large programs)
-U	flag undeclared variables (not universally available)
.P2
Other flags are passed on to the loader.

GCOS
.PP
The program
.UL \&./ratfor
is the bare translator, and is identical to the
.UC UNIX
version, except that the continuation convention
is 
.UL &
in column 6.
Thus
.P1
\&./ratfor  files  >output
.P2
translates the Ratfor source on
.UL files 
and
collects the generated Fortran on file
`output'
for subsequent processing.
.PP
.UL \&./rc
provides much the same services as
.UL rc 
(within the limitations of
.UC GCOS ),
regrettably with a somewhat different syntax.
Options recognized by
.UL ./rc
include
.P1
.ta 1.2i
name	Ratfor source or library, depending on type
h=/name	make TSS H* file (runnable version); run as /name
r=/name	update and use random library
a=	compile as ascii (default is bcd)
C=	copy comments into Fortran
f=name	Fortran source file
g=name	gmap source file
.P2
Other options are as specified for the
.UL \&./cc
command described in [4].

Ratfor exists on
various other systems;
