\s+4Ex differences \- version 1.1 to 2.0\s0
.sp .4i
.PP
This sheet summarizes the differences between the old version 1.1 of
.I ex
and the new version 2.0.
The new
.I ex
is available as the standard
.I ex
on the \s-2VAX\s0 on the 5th floor of Evans,
and as a new and experimental version
in /usr/new on the Cory 11/70.
It will soon be available in /usr/new on the Computer Center and Ingres
Machines.
Send problems over the Berkeley network to ``vax:bill''.

\s+2Changes to existing features\s0
.SH
Options.
.PP
The options
.I editany,
.I edited,
.I fork,
.I hush,
.I printall
and
.I sticky
have been deleted because of lack of use.
The
.I notify
option has been renamed
.I report.
.PP
The
.I home
option will soon be superseded by the environment feature of version 7
\s-2UNIX\s0 and has been deleted.
Similarly the
.I mode
option is superseded by the
.I umask
of version 7 and has also been deleted.
.PP
The
.I visualmessage
option has been deleted; use ``mesg n'' at the system command level
to inhibit interconsole messages.
.PP
The
.I iul
option is replaced by a more general mechanism which allows portions of the
buffer to be processed through specified commands; you can get
.I iul
processing on lines 1 to 100 of a file by doing ``1,100!iul''.
This replaces the lines 1 to 100 by the output of an
.I iul
command, giving the command these lines as input.
.SH
Invocation
.PP
The options
.B \-o,
.B \-n
and
.B \-p
have been deleted.
.SH
Filename formation
.PP
The alternate filename is now represented as `#' rather than `\`', since
`\`' is a shell metacharacter.  The editor now uses a shell to expand
filenames containing shell metacharacters.  If you use
.I csh,
then you can use all the shell metasyntax in forming new filenames,
including home directory references with `~' and variables you define in
.I \&.cshrc
using `$'.
.SH
Character representation
.PP
Control characters are now represented as `^\fIx\fR'; thus a control X is
printed as `^X'; the delete character is represented `^?'.
.SH
Command changes
.PP
There have been major changes to open/visual (incompatible ones are described
below).
.PP
It is no longer possible to
discard changes by repeating the
.I quit
command twice.
You must use the variant form \fBquit!\fR to get out of the editor discarding
changes.
Similarly the variant forms \fBe!\fR and \fBnext!\fR must be used to edit
a new file or the next file without saving changes you have made.\*(dg
.FS
\*(dg
Less useful are \fBrewind!\fR and \fBrecover!\fR.
.FE
.PP
A new form of the `!' shell escape replaces the
.I expand
and
.I tabulate
commands.
Thus the command ``1,10expand'' of the old version is replaced by
``1,10!expand'' in the new.
Note also that the command abbreviation 
.B ta
no longer refers to the
.I tabulate
command, which has been deleted, but rather refers to the new
.I tag
command.
.PP
The format of the
.I args
command has been changed; the files are no longer numbered, rather
the entire argument list is always printed with the current file name
enclosed by `[' and `]'.
.PP
The format of the
.I file
command output has been changed;
the editor says `[Not edited]' in the rare case that this is true rather
than saying `[Edited]'.  The command also gives the percentage of the way
into the buffer that the current line is.
.PP
The format of the
.I set
command has been improved;
``set all'' now prints in a three column format.
The commands ``set %'', ``set !'' and ``set \`'' have been deleted.
The command ``set'' now prints in a one line format rather than down
the screen.
.PP
The commands
.I echo,
.I expand,
.I help,
.I reset,
.I sync,
.I tabulate
and
.I xpand
have been deleted.

\s+2Changes to open and visual\s0
.PP
A large number of changes have been made to open and visual;
we summarize only the most noticeable ones here.  See the attached reference
card for more information, and (even if you know
how to use visual already) you should look at
.I "An Introduction to Text Editing with Vi".
We do not discuss any of the new commands in visual here.\(dg
.FS
\(dg It is now possible to edit with the focus of the editing
being
.I visual
using a command
.I vi
rather than
.I ex
on the command line, and
using a new \fB:\fR command from within visual to run command mode commands.
.FE
.PP
The delete line command is now \fBdd\fR rather than \fB\e\e\fR (\fB\e\e\fR
no longer works!.)
In fact, \fBd\fR and other operators can now operate on lines; thus
\fBdL\fR deletes to the last line on the screen.
The shift commands \fB<\fR and \fB>\fR are now operators, thus
\fB<<\fR and \fB>>\fR now have the effect that \fB<\fR and \fB>\fR used
to have.
.PP
The command \fBv\fR has been deleted; only its synonym \fBz\fR remains.
The \fBK\fR operation has been moved to \fBm\fR; \fBK\fR has no meaning
in the new version.
The \fB^S\fR operation has been deleted, but \fB^G\fR does a sync, and
also prints some information.
The \fB^W\fR operation has been deleted (use \fBB\fR).
The \fB#\fR, \fB@\fR and \fB^X\fR operations have been deleted.
To delete to the beginning of the line use \fBd0\fR; the commands and
\fBx\fR and \fBX\fR are similar to \fB#\fR.
.PP
During inputs, \fB^W\fR backs up like \fBb\fR rather than \fBB\fR.
.PP
Terminal support has been vastly improved; the editor will now drive most
any display terminal, using all terminal features such as cursor addressing,
clear to end of line, insert and delete line and insert and delete character.
To help performance on slow terminals some options are now set based on the
intelligence and speed of the terminal; in particular, the default window
size is 1/2 a full screen at 300 baud, or 2/3 of a full screen at 1200 baud.
