.LP
.B "Aimed at larger systems."
Devices are addressable to 2\u\s-231\s+2\d
bytes, files to 2\u\s-230\s+2\d bytes.
128K memory (separate instruction and data space) is needed for some utilities.
.LP
.B "Portability."
Code of the operating system and most utilities has
been extensively revised to minimize its
dependence on particular hardware.
.LP
.B "Fortran 77."
F77 compiler for the new standard language
is compatible with C at the object level.
A Fortran structurer, STRUCT, converts old, ugly Fortran into RATFOR,
a structured dialect usable with F77.
.LP
.B "Shell."
Completely new SH program supports string variables,
trap handling, structured programming, user profiles,
settable search path,
multilevel file name generation, etc.
.LP
.B "Document preparation."
TROFF phototypesetter utility is standard.
NROFF (for terminals) is now highly compatible
with TROFF.
MS macro package provides canned commands for
many common formatting and layout situations.
TBL provides an easy to learn language for preparing
complicated tabular material.
REFER fills in bibliographic citations
from a data base.
.LP
.B "UNIX-to-UNIX file copy."
UUCP performs spooled
file transfers between any two machines.
.LP
.B "Data processing."
SED stream editor does multiple editing functions
in parallel on a data stream of indefinite length.
AWK report generator does free-field pattern selection
and arithmetic operations.
.LP
.B "Program development."
MAKE
controls re-creation of complicated software,
arranging for minimal recompilation.
.LP
.B "Debugging."
ADB does postmortem and breakpoint debugging,
handles separate instruction and data spaces,
floating point, etc.
.LP
.B "C language."
The language now supports
definable data types, generalized initialization,
block structure, long integers,
unions,
explicit type conversions.
The LINT verifier does strong type checking
and detection of probable errors and portability problems
even across separately compiled functions.
.LP
.B "Lexical analyzer generator."
LEX converts specification of regular expressions
and semantic actions into a recognizing subroutine.
Analogous to YACC.
.LP
.B "Graphics."
Simple graph-drawing utility, graphic subroutines, and
generalized plotting filters adapted to various devices
are now standard.
.LP
.B "Standard input-output package."
Highly efficient buffered stream I/O is
integrated with formatted input and output.
.LP
.B "Other."
The operating system and utilities have been enhanced
and freed of restrictions in many
other ways too numerous to relate.
