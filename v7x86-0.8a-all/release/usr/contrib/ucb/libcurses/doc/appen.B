.sh 1 "The WINDOW structure" 1
.pp
The WINDOW structure is defined as follows:
.(l I
.so win_st.gr
.)l
.pp
.Vn \*_cury \\*
.(f
\**
All variables not normally accessed directly by the user
are named with an initial
.Bq \*_
to avoid conflicts with the user's variables.
.)f
and
.Vn \*_curx
are the current \*y for the window.
New characters added to the screen
are added at this point.
.Vn \*_maxy
and
.Vn \*_maxx
are the maximum values allowed for
.Vn \*_cury\*,\*_curx ). (
.Vn \*_begy
and
.Vn \*_begx
are the starting \*y on the terminal for the window,
i.e.,
the window's home.
.Vn \*_cury ,
.Vn \*_curx ,
.Vn \*_maxy ,
and
.Vn \*_maxx
are measured relative to
.Vn \*_begy\*,\*_begx ), (
not the terminal's home.
.pp
.Vn \*_clear
tells if a clear-screen sequence is to be generated
on the next
.Fn refresh
call.
This is only meaningful for screens.
The initial clear-screen for the first
.Fn refresh
call is generated by initially setting clear to be TRUE for
.Vn curscr ,
which always generates a clear-screen if set,
irrelevant of the dimensions of the window involved.
.Vn \*_leave
is TRUE if the current \*y and the cursor
are to be left after the last character changed on the terminal,
or not moved if there is no change.
.Vn \*_scroll
is TRUE
if scrolling is allowed.
.pp
.Vn \*_y
is a pointer to an array of lines which describe the terminal.
Thus:
.(l
\*_y[i]
.)l
.lp
is a pointer to the
.Vn i th
line, and
.(l
\*_y[i][j]
.)l
.lp
is the
.Vn j th
character on the
.Vn i th
line.
.pp
.Vn \*_flags
can have one or more values
or'd into it.
.b \*_SUBWIN
means that the window is a subwindow,
which indicates to
.Fn delwin
that the space for the lines is not to be freed.
.b \*_ENDLINE
says that the end of the line for this window
is also the end of a screen.
.b \*_FULLWIN
says that this window is a screen.
.b \*_SCROLLWIN
indicates that the last character of this screen
is at the lower right-hand corner of the terminal;
.i i.e. ,
if a character was put there,
the terminal would scroll.
.b \*_STANDOUT
says that all characters added to the screen
are in standout mode.
