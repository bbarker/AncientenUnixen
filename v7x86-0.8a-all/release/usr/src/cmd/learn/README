The C script is not complete; use at your own risk.

Lessons are in
	/usr/lib/learn/*
Source is in
	/usr/src/cmd/learn
Miscellaneous supporting code is also in source.

Make a learn by
	make
When this seems right, extract the lessons by
	make lessons
This extracts the lesson archives
for each course.  You can also do this one step at a
time with "make files", "make editor", etc.,
if you don't want all courses.
If you do things separately, you must also say
	make play; make log

Finally, check that it's sensible with
	make check
If that doesn't print any messages,
you're probably in good shape.

Learn requires general write permission on the user playpen
directory .../lib/play.  Lesson directories may be protected.

Learn collects a log file for each script in the .../lib/log
directory, with a file for each script (files,
editor, etc.) containing an entry for each lesson
attempted. These files will grow without bound,
unless they are periodically truncated. 
The log files should have general write permission.
If you don't want logging (a sensible position to take),
set the variable "logging" to zero in source/lrndef
before making learn.

Learn requires about 1500 blocks to make itself,
and about 1000 when completely made.

Please report problems, bad lessons, etc., to
