.SH NAME
cd \- change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cd
directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Directory
becomes the new working directory.
The process must have execute (search)
permission in
.IR directory .
.PP
Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.I cd
would be ineffective if it were written as a
normal command.  It is therefore recognized and executed
by the Shell.
