.TH WAIT 1 
.SH NAME
wait \- await completion of process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wait
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wait until all processes started with
.B &
have completed,
and report on abnormal terminations.
.PP
Because the
.IR  wait (2)
system call
must be executed in the parent process,
the Shell itself executes
.I wait,
without creating a new process.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
sh(1)
.SH BUGS
Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage
pipeline are children of the Shell, and
thus can't be waited for.
