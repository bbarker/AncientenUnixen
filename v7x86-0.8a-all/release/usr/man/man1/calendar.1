.TH CALENDAR 1 
.SH NAME
calendar \- reminder service
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calendar
[ \- ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Calendar 
consults the file `calendar' in the current directory
and prints out lines that contain today's or
tomorrow's date anywhere in the line.
Most reasonable month-day dates such as `Dec. 7,'
`december 7,' `12/7,' etc., are recognized, but not
`7 December' or `7/12'.
On weekends `tomorrow' extends through Monday.
.PP
When 
an argument is present,
.I calendar
does its job for every user
who has a file `calendar' in his login directory
and sends him any positive results by
.IR mail (1).
Normally this is done daily in the wee hours under control of
.IR cron (8).
