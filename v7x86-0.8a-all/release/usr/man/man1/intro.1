.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon termination each command returns two bytes of status,
one supplied by the system giving the cause for
termination, and (in the case of `normal' termination)
one supplied by the program,
see
.I wait
and
.IR exit (2).
The former byte is 0 for normal termination, the latter
is customarily 0 for successful execution, nonzero
to indicate troubles such as erroneous parameters, bad or inaccessible data,
or other inability to cope with the task at hand.
It is called variously `exit code', `exit status' or
`return code', and is described only where special
conventions are involved.
