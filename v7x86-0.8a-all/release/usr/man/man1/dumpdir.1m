of all the files and directories on the tape.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the dump extends over more than one tape,
it may ask you to change tapes.
Reply with a new-line when the next tape has been mounted.
.SH BUGS
There is redundant information on the tape
that could be used in case of tape reading problems.
Unfortunately,
.I dumpdir
doesn't use it.
