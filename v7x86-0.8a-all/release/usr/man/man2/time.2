.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Time
returns the time since 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970, measured
in seconds.
.PP
If
.I tloc
is nonnull,
the return value is also stored in the
place to which
.I tloc
points.
.PP
The
.I ftime
entry fills in a structure pointed to by its argument,
as defined by
.IR <sys/timeb.h> :
.PP
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'unsigned 'u
.so /usr/include/sys/timeb.h
.fi
.PP
The structure contains the time since the epoch in seconds,
up to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval,
the local timezone (measured in minutes of time westward from Greenwich),
and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.
