RELNOTES: V7/x86


V7/x86 version 0.8a is the first public release of V7/x86.

The following limitations apply to the distribution:

    *  The source to the C compiler is not part of the distribution.
       This is currently built separately as a component of a
       modified version of the Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK).

    *  The source for boot (the second stage bootstrap) is not part
       of the distribution.  This is currently built separately
       using a 16-bit version of pcc.
