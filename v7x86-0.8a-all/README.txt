V7/x86 was a port of the Seventh Edition of the UNIX operating system
to the x86 (IA-32) based PC: UNIX V7 being the last general
distribution — around 1979 — to come from the Research group at Bell
Labs, the original home of UNIX. The port was begun in 1999 when
"Ancient UNIX" source code licenses first became available, and code
was revised, with some enhancements, during 2006-7.

V7/x86 supported ATA (IDE) hard drives, ATAPI CDROM drives, a 1.44M
floppy drive, and standard serial ports, in addition to the usual PC
screen and keyboard. For easier installation and setup, supplied
utilities allowed access to CD (ISO 9660) and FAT (MS-DOS)
filesystems.

Extras included a custom UNIX-style x86 assembler, an ACK (Amsterdam
Compiler Kit) based C compiler, and several key early UCB software
components such as the C shell, the editors ex and vi, and the pager
more. Source code was made available under a BSD-style license.

The hardware that v7/x86 was intended to run on — floppy drives,
serial ports, and all — is no longer readily available, although it
remains possible to try out v7/x86, given suitable virtual machine
software, and with careful setup. Be aware, however, that this was
beta software and not a polished release: most things work reasonably
well, but there are exceptions.
